Background

We want to know what makes voters tick. The traditional metrics of slicing and dicing the electorate according to income class, gender, race, educational attainment have been tried and tested already, but it still lacks predictive power [7]. A common analysis of the electorate assumes that we are cleaved into two, bitterly divided camps: the Dilawans vs. DDS here in the Philippines, and the Democrats vs. the GOP in the US. We reject that simplistic conclusion. While the choices are binary [1] voter sentiment varies, and beliefs overlap.

Surveys reflects voter sentiment at a particular time. The weakness of surveys manifest itself when the candidates are deemed "socially" unacceptable [9]. Historical analysis also fails [8]. In this analysis, we propose another hypothesis: people vote according to their identity. While class, gender, race, and religion influence identity they are not the only predictor; news consumption, and social behavior do to.

The average electorate lives in a bubble. That bubble reflects their identity. In the past, those bubbles are geographic and socio-economic in nature, but social media changed that. The bubble we live in now are the friends we add, the pages we like, the news sources we subscribe to, and the influencers we follow. Living in a bubble changes our identities as voters.  

Our work also rests on another fundamental assumption: voter sentiment reflects a normal distribution curve. While events [5], and candidates [6] can skew the curve from time to time, we will treat sentiment as evenly distributed. What does it mean? It means that the average voter are non-partisan in nature. The angry back and forth in twitter and Facebook does not reflect the feelings of the vast majority of the electorate.

This analysis will take election results as is. Faulty a method as it may be, we have no choice but to trust in the integrity of voting machines. Thankfully, in the Philippines, we had computerized elections since 2010. And despite what Mar Roxas (in 2010) and BongBong Marcos (in 2016) claim, chances are they really did lose their respective race. 

In the end, we want to create a platform to measure a "voter identity index" on a scale of -1 to +1 [2]. Negative one are for those deeply entrenched in the progressive camp. Positive one are for hard-core right-wingers. Zero are for undecided, persuadable voters [3]. 

The value of this project will manifest itself in those that score in the range of -0.2 to +0.2 (or near zero) [4]. These are the voters that decide elections. We want to measure how many they are, and we want to know what will make them shade for a particular candidate. Ultimately, we want to sell the result of this study to the highest bidder. 

Footnotes:

[1] Despite being a multi-party democracy, Philippine elections usually boils down to two choices: Mar vs. Digong in 2016, Erap vs. NoyNoy in 2010,  FPJ vs. GMA in 2004, Erap vs. JDV in 1998, and Miriam vs. FVR in 1992. 

[2] An arbitrary range. 

[3] We assign the positive and negative side to reflect the traditional description of right and left wing camps. A negative score does not attribute a negative identity. 

[4] This value can change.

[5] Economic booms/crises, natural calamities, pandemics, and terrorist attacks are examples of these events.

[6] Polarizing figures such as Duterte, Trump, Bolsanaro, and Modi are examples of these candidates. Edrogan and Putin are also immensely polarizing, but the lack of viable alternatives (and free elections) have permanently skewed the electorate.

[7] Trump's relatively strong performance in Latino and Black communities in 2020, and Duterte's middle-class, educated base are two phenomena that the traditional way of analyzing election fails to account for. 

[8] Mar Roxas placed second in the 2016 presidential election. In 2019, he fails to crack the top 12 in the senatorial race.

[9] Donald's over performance in 2016 and 2020 relative to what the mainstream media (and Nate Silver) projects shows that there is really such as thing as a "closeted" Trump supporter.

# Election Analytics Motivation

As a political junkie, the US election holds my attention. In my teens, I memorized all the states in America and their corresponding electoral votes. Election year after election year, I religiously followed the results from the primary to the convention to the election night up to the inauguration.

In 2016, Donald Trump's upset victory over Hilary Clinton shook my framework for analyzing US politics. How can a political newbie, written off by experts after the Access Hollywood tapes, built a winning coalition to deliver the defining political victory of our time? Finding answer to that question drove me to not only look at the narrative but to explore the shifting battlefield of politics.

The revelation than Cambridge Analytica helped deliver Trump's victory thrilled me. It confirmed my initial inkling that the public square had moved online. Elections can now be won and lost using social media. Despite the proliferation of fake news, I still believe that this development has the potential to improve the playing field. Candidates still needs money to win, but not too much of it. A clever social media campaign can also do the trick. 


Now that Facebook is the battlefield, the next question arise: how to win in it? The answer lies deeper than the standard liberal excuse that Trump only won because of fake news and Russian spies. Trump won because he stirred in his voters a feeling of belonging. He gave them an identity.

The next question then becomes "can we measure identity?" Can our posts, likes, and follows reveal a hidden desire, and an affinity to something that we don't necessarily admit to even our closest friends? I suspect that the answer to that question is yes. If you follow Mocha and likes her posts a lot, then chances are you are a dds. The same is true for PAB and dilawans.  

Liking or not liking obvious partisan pages are dead giveaways. I am not interested in persuading the unpersuadables. I want to go deeper and wider. Wider in a sense that I want to measure the tendencies of apolitical voters (i.e. the independents). Deeper in a sense that aside from political and news posts, can I also detect behavior thru other posts? Whether you like Apple or Windows? Whether you buy Tide or Surf? Are you a BTS army? Do you watch anime? Do you like KDrama? These are the non-obvious questions that I want to relate to politics. In short, I want to answer the question: does our subconscious influence our vote? In a way elections are about choices, and we choose according to our identity. 

Can we make an independent vote for Leni if we flood her feed with cat videos? Can we prime the mind to accept a message that we want them to act on? Can we manufacture identity? Can we perform social engineering on a mass scale? These are the questions I want to answer.

The election product that I want to develop goes deeper than the basic dashboards, and maps. I want to go beyond demographics. I want to go from explaining why somebody won, to actually helping him win. In a sense, I want to do a mass scale "inception". With the tools that we have today (the APIs, the processing power, the algorithms, the computing skills) can we actually influence an election beyond peddling in propaganda and fake news?

If the answer is no. Then we can shelve the project. But if it is yes, then the next question is: is it moral to do so? Is it ethical to mind fuck someone thru cute baby videos just to win an election? I say yes. And for the right amount of money, I am willing to work on it.
